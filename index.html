Supermarket - Local (PHP + MySQL)
==================================

Instructions:
1. Install XAMPP (or similar) and start Apache & MySQL.
2. Copy this project folder to your webroot, e.g., C:\xampp\htdocs\supermarket
3. Import 'db.sql' into MySQL (phpMyAdmin or CLI). This creates database and default admin user.
4. Edit 'config.php' if your DB user/password are different.
5. Open browser: http://localhost/supermarket/index.php
6. Login with default admin:
   - username: admin
   - password: 1234
7. Only admin can add/edit/delete items and change the admin password (Settings > Change Admin Password).
8. Sales can be recorded by logged-in user (admin). If you want cashier accounts, add users to the 'users' table with role 'cashier'.

Security notes:
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt.
- Change the default admin password after first login.
- This version is for local/network use. For Internet exposure, configure HTTPS and secure the server properly.
